# Day 09 - Your Task

## Build a “Form Wizard” Component using the State Reducer Pattern

The wizard should have multiple steps (next, prev, reset).

- Internal reducer manages state transitions.
- Allow parent component to provide a custom reducer that, for example:
  - Prevents skipping incomplete steps.
  - Auto-saves data on next.

## Integrate with a Provider Context

Create a Progress Bar that multiple components can aceess.
