# Day 06 - Your Task

You’ve learned what Hooks are, how to write Custom Hooks, and how they make your components reusable and clean.
Now it’s your turn to design and build 3 useful hooks like anyone can use in real-world apps.

Create the following custom hooks from scratch, without relying on external libraries:

- useLocalStorage(key, initialValue): Sync a React state with localStorage.
- useClipboard(): Copy text to clipboard and show feedback.
- useClickOutside(ref, callback): Detect clicks outside a given element.

## Criteria

Each hook must:

- Be reusable and follow the Rules of Hooks.
- Include error handling or edge cases.
- Be demonstrated in a small component that shows how to use it.
